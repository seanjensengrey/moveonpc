# Supporting the PlayStation Move controller on the PC #

In October/September 2010 Sony released the PlayStation Move â€“ a motion-sensing game controller for the PlayStation 3. The Move controller is an excellent input device which can be used for very accurate input but all software development for PC support has to be done from scratch.

**The primary point of contact is our [PS Move Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/d/forum/psmove)**

## Two Summer of Code projects for the MoveOnPC project ##

**May 2012**: We are participating in the Google Summer of Code. We will keep you updated about our progress here. The old code base will be archived in the Downloads section soon, and we will base our future MoveOnPC work on Thomas Perl's "PS Move API" project, but add support for tracking and computer vision to the library. Another important aspect of the Summer of Code project is sensor fusion - i.e. getting the inertial sensor data merged with information retrieved from the camera image.
